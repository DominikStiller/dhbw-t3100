In this chapter, we will look at the design of the state estimation and the vehicle platform it will be deployed to. The state estimation is built from the ground up, so there is a lot of flexibility regarding the design choices. The design is deliberately described in terms of generic components, enabling adoption on other platforms and software environments.
