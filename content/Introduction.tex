Race cars have fascinated people, built quickly after first car
instead of comfort, max performance
more examples of tradeoffs

\section{Problem}
more than xx years since first car
while mindset is same, now there are electric race cars
new possibilities because of \gls{4wd} and computing power
individual torque on each wheel
computer assist driver in getting max performance, execution of driver commands with optimal use of vehicle potential
TC, TV, battery management
components need estimate of vehicle state
task of state estimation which delivers good estimate even in face of sensor failures and unpredictable environment

\section{Scope}
this thesis describes design of a robust, accurate, flexible state estimation for a formula student race car
maybe a research question?
this state estimation fuses available sensors and detects outliers
first background, then design and implementation
then evaluation with measurement data

project for DHBW engineering team but works in other cars as well
