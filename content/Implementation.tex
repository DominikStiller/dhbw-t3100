Since whole VDC is in Simulink because supported by ES910, state estimation as well
Describe Simulink features: subsystems, busses, blocks

Simulink acts as glue, great for modelling signal flow
Matlab code for key algorithm implementations, more readable and unit testable, clear architecture requirement
State estimation is separate model to allow for independent development
Architecture components as subsystems
Reused components referenced model

Strict busses and datatypes, units in simulink to avoid logical errors that are hard to find at compile-time

Integration in VDC
only model-in-the-loop testing with measurement data because complete setup was not available during development for HIL
Build process and toolchain incl intecrio and inca for live telematics, monitoring and parametrization

requires application for covariances during testing
