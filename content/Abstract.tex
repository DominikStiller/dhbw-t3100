Modern electric race cars use sophisticated vehicle dynamics control software to exploit the maximum physical potential of the vehicle. For the best results, an accurate and robust state estimate even in the face of measurement failures and missing sensors is required. In this thesis, we describe the design and Simulink-based implementation of a three-stage state estimation. We propose methods for fusion of different sensors and a unified failure and sensor setup detection. We show our design's merit using a simulation with real sensor data.
