Modern electric race cars use sophisticated vehicle dynamics control software to exploit the maximum physical potential of the vehicle. For the best results, an accurate and robust state estimate even in the face of measurement failures and missing sensors is required. In this thesis, we describe the design and Simulink-based implementation of a three-stage state estimation, comprising mean-based and extended Kalman filter-based measurement fusion combined with a unified failure and sensor setup detection. We show our design's merit by evaluating the implementation in a simulation with real sensor data and find that it works generally well but lacks accuracy in certain sensor setups.
