In this thesis, we first presented different approaches for state estimation and failure detection. Then we described the design and implementation of a robust and flexible state estimation for a race car. At the core is a simple three-stage architecture, comprising a preprocessing component for measurement harmonization and \gls{imu} fusion, a unified failure and sensor setup detection providing robustness and support for flexible sensor sets, and an \gls{ekf}-based state estimation performing model-based sensor fusion. Our evaluation shows that the provided state estimate is accurate even in the presence of outliers and sensor failures.

future work
try unscented KF, but not very important because ekf works well
wheel speed stuff
integrate better with DV and use lidar/cam information
possibly reimplement in DV software in future
initialization of position
imu calibration (rotation)
