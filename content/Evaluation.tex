Fundamental: no ground truth, therefore residuals are a good indicator
non-zero-mean residual means model mismatch~\cite[p.~158]{AlexanderWischnewski.2019}

Results
bad position in EV without heading measurements, because velocity cannot be used properly to estimate position
compare raw measurements with velocity estimate
show results for each state variable
effect of different debouncing times and thresholds

compare max change rate and mean based

max likelihood IMU fusion not better for omega and a, but less noise for alpha when more than 2 imus -> better EKF results
use mean based fusion because occams razor

show all wssrs for ekf bank
maybe compare with other outlier detection approaches


Discussion, impact of results on esleek
prepare for DV
