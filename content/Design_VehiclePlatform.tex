The state estimation described in this thesis will be deployed to two electric race cars:
\begin{itemize}
\item a non-autonomous race car which is newly designed and manufactured
\item an autonomous race car which is already existing but repurposed
\end{itemize}
These vehicles will in the following be referred to as \gls{ev} and \gls{dv}, respectively. Note that the \gls{dv} is electric as well but has additional components required for autonomous driving.

\subsection{Sensor Setup}\label{sec:design-sensor-setup}
The vehicles are equipped with a plethora of sensors, which can be used for state estimation. The relevant sensors are listed in table \ref{tab:sensor}, with the last two columns denoting in which vehicle they are available. The sensors' locations in the vehicle shown in figure \ref{fig:sensor-locations} In the ideal case, both vehicles would have all sensors, since working with a homogeneous set of measurements is simpler, but financial and weight considerations mean that only the sensors essential for the vehicle's use case are available.

\begin{description}
\item[IMU] The \gls{ev} features three \glspl{imu} with gyrometers to measure linear accelerations and angular velocities: one directly in front of the \gls{cog}, and two situated on the rear left and right. This enables redundancy, since accelerations and rotations in the two-dimensional plane only require two \glspl{imu}. In the \gls{dv}, the front one remains while only a single rear one, denoted by the circle with the missing center, is located directly behind the \gls{cog}. While these sensors react very fast, the signals are rather noisy~\cite[p.~19~ff.]{Biel.2019}.

\item[Optical velocity sensor] The optical cross-correlation velocity sensor, only available in the \gls{ev}, provides longitudinal and lateral speed measurements, and therefore also measurements of the vehicle sideslip angle. It enables slip-free velocity measurements by correlating photosensor information of the surface over time, which uniquely determines the speed and direction of movement~\cite{Bellof.4241993}. The fact that it is not influenced by slip, as opposed to velocity measurements from wheel speeds, makes it a highly valuable addition to the sensor setup. However, it is noisy and prone to temporary spikes and even failures on feature-less surfaces (see dark red line in figure \ref{fig:velocities} at \SI{5.2}{\second}).

\item[GNSS] A \gls{gnss} receiver is mounted in the front of both vehicles. Next to position measurements, they provide another source of speed information. The position accuracy is high in the range of a few centimeters. However, it is slow to react, with over \SI{100}{\milli\second} of delay in some situations~\cite[p.~27]{Biel.2019} (see dark grey line in figure \ref{fig:velocities}). The receiver mounted in the \gls{dv} additionally provides heading information, made possible by the relative position of two separated antennas mounted in the front and rear. This enables transformation of the speed into a velocity vector.

\item[Motor speed sensor] The rotary encoders in each of the four motors give individual rotation speed measurements for the four wheels. They are available in both vehicles and are assumed to be reliable, since the vehicle will not drive when they fail. However, when using them to calculate the vehicle velocity, deviations due to slip occur in highly dynamic situations (see light grey line in figure \ref{fig:velocities} at \SI{3.8}{\second})
\end{description}

\end{figure}

To summarize, the key differences between the \gls{ev} and \gls{dv} are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Three \glspl{imu} in \gls{ev} but two \glspl{imu} in \gls{dv}
\item No optical cross-correlation velocity sensor in \gls{dv}
\item No heading information in \gls{ev}
\end{itemize}
The lack of the optical velocity sensor in the \gls{dv} is inconvenient but not fatal, since the state estimation can compensate it. For track and obstacle recognition, the autonomous \gls{dv} is furthermore equipped with stereo cameras and lidar sensors. These could be used for optical flow computations to gain more position, attitude and velocity information, but for this design, we rely solely on the sensors described in the previous paragraphs. The estimated state is, however, used to correct lidar measurements.


\subsection{Computation System}\label{sec:design-computation-system}
All sensor and control signals converge via a \gls{can} bus at the central \gls{ecu}. The software running on that \gls{ecu} is called \gls{vdc} and has several important tasks:
\begin{itemize}
\item Receive driver input from steering wheel and pedals
\item Send torque requests to each of the four motors
\item Limit speed and torque depending on situation
\item Increase vehicle agility and stability through \gls{tv}
\item Optimize use of tire potential through \gls{tc}
\end{itemize}
Ultimately, the \gls{vdc}'s task is to help the driver to exploit the maximum physical potential of the vehicle through its \gls{tv} and \gls{tc}, collectively called performance components.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{architecture_integration}%
	\caption{Integration of state estimation in software/hardware system}
	\label{fig:architecture-integration}
\end{figure}

The state estimation is logically located between the sensors and the aforementioned performance components, and is therefore part of the \gls{vdc} as well. The integration with input and output signals is shown in figure \ref{fig:architecture-integration}. While the \gls{vdc} is executed at a fixed rate, sensor inputs may arrive at different rates. For example, the \gls{vdc} runs at \SI{1000}{\hertz}, i.e. it is scheduled to be executed every \SI{1}{\milli\second}, but optical velocity sensor measurements may arrive at \SI{250}{\hertz} and \gls{gnss} measurements even slower at \SI{5}{\hertz}. This may be due to a measurement overhead, such as satellite communication in case of the \gls{gnss}, which prohibits higher rates, but it may also be a conscious choice to reduce bus load and thus congestion. The state estimation must be able to fuse these measurements at different rates while providing continuous estimates at the highest rate. The time since the arrival of the last measurement is provided to aid this task. Note that this is different from incorporating \textit{delayed} measurements, which is a much harder task.

The software to control autonomous driving in the \gls{dv} runs on a separate, more powerful computer, which receives the state estimate from the \gls{ecu}. The \gls{ecu} then receives pseudo-driver inputs back from the motion controller and sends torque requests to the motors. However, the interface with the \gls{dv} software is beyond the scope of this thesis.
