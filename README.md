# Robust state estimation for an electric race car

This repository contains the data analysis code and paper for the development of a new state estimation for the [eSleek 19](https://www.dhbw-engineering.de/esleek19/) and subsequent generations. The eSleek vehicles are electric four-wheel-drive race cars developed by the [DHBW Engineering](https://www.dhbw-engineering.de/) team, participating in the student engineering competition Formula Student.

The paper detailing the design and analysis of the new state estimation can be found [here](T3100.pdf).
