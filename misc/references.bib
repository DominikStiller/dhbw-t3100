 abstract = {Autonomous driving requires accurate information about the vehicle pose and motion state in order to achieve precise tracking of the planned trajectory. In this paper we propose a robust architecture to localize a high performance race car and show experimental results with speeds up to 150 km h-1 and utilizing approximately 80{\%} of the available friction level. The concept has been applied using the development vehicle DevBot taking part in the Roborace competition. To achieve robust and reliable performance, we use two independent localization pipelines, one based on GPS and one on LIDARs. We propose to fuse them via a Kalman Filter based on a purely kinematic model and show, that it can outperform a high fidelity model under realistic race conditions. An outstanding property of this concept is that it does not depend on any of the vehicles parameter and is therefore robust to varying tire and track conditions. Further we present an adaption method for the measurement covariances based on the track layout. This allows to combine the strengths of each localization method.},

@article{Bancroft.2011,
 abstract = {A single low cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) is often used in conjunction with GPS to increase the accuracy and improve the availability of the navigation solution for a pedestrian navigation system. This paper develops several fusion algorithms for using multiple IMUs to enhance performance. In particular, this research seeks to understand the benefits and detriments of each fusion method in the context of pedestrian navigation. Three fusion methods are proposed. First, all raw IMU measurements are mapped onto a common frame (i.e., a virtual frame) and processed in a typical combined GPS-IMU Kalman filter. Second, a large stacked filter is constructed of several IMUs. This filter construction allows for relative information between the IMUs to be used as updates. Third, a federated filter is used to process each IMU as a local filter. The output of each local filter is shared with a master filter, which in turn, shares information back with the local filters. The construction of each filter is discussed and improvements are made to the virtual IMU (VIMU) architecture, which is the most commonly used architecture in the literature. Since accuracy and availability are the most important characteristics of a pedestrian navigation system, the analysis of each filter's performance focuses on these two parameters. Data was collected in two environments, one where GPS signals are moderately attenuated and another where signals are severely attenuated. Accuracy is shown as a function of architecture and the number of IMUs used.},

@article{Chindamo.2018,
 abstract = {Typical active safety systems that control the dynamics of passenger cars rely on the real-time monitoring of the vehicle sideslip angle (VSA), together with other signals such as the wheel angular velocities, steering angle, lateral acceleration, and the rate of rotation about the vertical axis, which is known as the yaw rate. The VSA (also known as the attitude or ``drifting'' angle) is defined as the angle between the vehicle's longitudinal axis and the direction of travel, taking the centre of gravity as a reference. It is basically a measure of the misalignment between vehicle orientation and trajectory; therefore, it is a vital piece of information enabling directional stability assessment, such as in transience following emergency manoeuvres, for instance. As explained in the introduction, the VSA is not measured directly for impracticality, and it is estimated on the basis of available measurements such as wheel velocities, linear and angular accelerations, etc. This work is intended to provide a comprehensive literature review on the VSA estimation problem. Two main estimation methods have been categorised, i.e., observer-based and neural network-based, focussing on the most effective and innovative approaches. As the first method normally relies on a vehicle model, a review of the vehicle models has been included. The advantages and limitations of each technique have been highlighted and discussed.},

@inproceedings{Gu.2008,
 abstract = {Many researches indicated that in land vehicle-based MEMS IMU/DGPS integrated navigation system, the vehicle heading is unobservable and its error can grow significantly fast with time, if the vehicle moves with only slow changes in attitude and acceleration, e.g. the vehicle moving along a straight road at almost constant velocity. In this paper, a new heading measurement is derived from the DGPS positions and this new measurement can improve the heading accuracy of MEMS IMU/DGPS integrated navigation system for land vehicle. However, the DGPS-derived heading will have a significant deviation from the true heading value while the vehicle makes a turn. Thus a sequential Kalman filter is proposed to process the DGPS position and heading measurements in a sequential order with MEM IMU measurements. This ensures the DGPS position measurements still can be used in the KF even if the DGPS heading measurements are unusable due to large deviation to the truth. To ensure the quality of the DGPS heading measurements, an innovation detection method is used to detect and reject the singular DGPS heading measurement from the sequential Kalman filter. A field test was conducted to test the effect of this new heading measurement on improving land vehicle heading accuracy. The test results showed that this new type of measurement can significantly reduce the heading error of MEMS IMU/DGPS integrated navigation solution from about 5 deg to less than 1 deg. Test results also showed that the innovation detection method can effectively control the quality of DGPS heading measurement. Without this control, the singular heading measurement would lead to a heading error as large as 100 deg. In summary, the introduction of DGPS-derived new heading measurement and the innovation detection method investigated in this paper can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of the heading parameter in land vehicle MEMS IMU/DGPS integrated navigation system.},

@inproceedings{KajiroWatanabe.1992,
 abstract = {Accurate information of the absolute speed of a vehicle, when available, can be vital in simplifying the control laws of an anti-lock braking system (ABS) and auto-traction system (ATS). A current meter for measuring the speed of a vehicle is to multiply the measured wheel rotation rate to the wheel radius. The approach often includes abrupt unpredictable errors due to slip and skid of wheels and a biased error due to the steady state slip. These errors are sources of difficulty in the implementation of an ABS that is based on the absolute speed of the vehicle.This paper describes an accurate rule-based Kalman filtering technique for estimating the absolute speed of a vehicle. The enhanced accuracy is achieved by employing an additional accelerometer to complement the wheel speed-based speedometer. The accelerometer measures the acceleration of the vehicle in its forward direction and may be corrupted as well by high frequency noise.The proposed sensing technique employs the extended Kalman filter to reduce the high frequency noises in the acceleration measurement and the biased error coming from the wheel speed measurement. Furthermore, we incorporate a rule-based strategy that switches the values of the Kalman filter coefficients to compensate for abrupt nonstationary errors in the measurement. The rules are developed based on a simple set of knowledge. For example, when skid or slip occurs, the wheel speed measurement may be quite erroneous; therefore, heavier reliance on the acceleration measurements would be placed over that of the wheel speed. Simulations and laboratory model experiments were carried out to verify the proposed rule-based estimation strategy and prove that it can accurately estimate the absolute speed even when wheel slip or skid occurs.},

This approach uses multiple Kalman filters, each of which is designed for detecting a specific sensor or actuator fault. In the event that a fault does occur, all filters except the one using the correct hypothesis will produce large estimation errors, thereby isolating the specific fault. In the meantime, a set of parameters that indicate engine component performance is estimated for the detection of abrupt degradation. The proposed FDI approach is applied to a nonlinear engine simulation at nominal and aged conditions, and the evaluation results for various engine faults at cruise operating conditions are given. The ability of the proposed approach to reliably detect and isolate sensor and actuator faults is demonstrated.},

Despite a solid theoretical ground for its approximation, it is seldom used in applications, where the EKF and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) are the standard algorithms. One reason for this might be the requirement for analytical Jacobian and Hessian of the system equations, and the high complexity that scales with the state order nx as n5x. We propose a numerical algorithm which is based on an extended set of sigma points (compared to the UKF) that needs neither Jacobian nor Hessian (or numerical approximations of these). Further, it scales as n4x, which is an order of magnitude better than the EKF2 algorithm presented in literature.},

@inproceedings{SimonJ.Julier.1997,
 abstract = {The Kalman Filter (KF) is one of the most widely used methods for tracking and estimation due to its simplicity, optimality, tractability and robustness. However, the application of the KF to nonlinear systems can be difficult. The most common approach is to use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) which simply linearizes all nonlinear models so that the traditional linear Kalman filter can be applied. Although the EKF (in its many forms) is a widely used filtering strategy, over thirty years of experience with it has led to a general consensus within the tracking and control community that it is difficult to implement, difficult to tune, and only reliable for systems which are almost linear on the time scale of the update intervals. In this paper a new linear estimator is developed and demonstrated. Using the principle that a set of discretely sampled points can be used to parameterize mean and covariance, the estimator yields performance equivalent to the KF for linear systems yet generalizes elegantly to nonlinear systems without the linearization steps required by the EKF. We show analytically that the expected performance of the new approach is superior to that of the EKF and, in fact, is directly comparable to that of the second order Gauss filter. The method is not restricted to assuming that the distributions of noise sources are Gaussian. We argue that the ease of implementation and more accurate estimation features of the new filter recommend its use over the EKF in virtually all applications.},

 abstract = {Velocity estimation plays a central role in driverless vehicles, but standard and affordable methods struggle to cope with extreme scenarios like aggressive maneuvers due to the presence of high sideslip. To solve this, autonomous race cars are usually equipped with expensive external velocity sensors. In this paper, we present an end-to-end recurrent neural network that takes available raw sensors as input (IMU, wheel odometry, and motor currents) and outputs velocity estimates. The results are compared to two state-of-the-art Kalman filters, which respectively include and exclude expensive velocity sensors. All methods have been extensively tested on a formula student driverless race car with very high sideslip (10{\deg} at the rear axle) and slip ratio ({\~{}}20{\%}), operating close to the limits of handling. The proposed network is able to estimate lateral velocity up to 15x better than the Kalman filter with the equivalent sensor input and matches (0.06 m/s RMSE) the Kalman filter with the expensive velocity sensor setup.},
